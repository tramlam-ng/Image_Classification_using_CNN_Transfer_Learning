# Image_Classification_using_CNN_Transfer_Learning

- To classify image, the very baby step is apply random base CNN model to briefly see how it works on the dataset and tried to apply transfer learning and fine-tuning the transfered model.
- In this notebook, I tried to classify simple and clean dataset with Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Some state-of-the-art in CNN were used like MobileNetV2 and Xception.
